# Hello, World! 👋 I'm Michele (or Michael if you prefer)

Welcome to my GitHub profile! 👨‍💻

I've been immersed in the vast world of Java for over 5 years, and there's no sign of me surfacing any time soon! 😄

As a freelancer working for **NetherixStudios** and **Fiverr**, I've enjoyed the flexibility of crafting software solutions for a diverse range of clients and industries. I'm always ready for new challenges and love expanding my skillset with each project. 

Currently, my passion project is building up a new development platform, **MikesLab**. Here, I plan to not only showcase my own development work, but also to contribute to the larger developer community through collaboration and knowledge sharing.

My most exciting ongoing projects involve developing Java plug-ins for **Spigot, Bukkit, BungeeCord, and PaperMC**. I'm thrilled to be working with these technologies, and I'm excited to share my progress with you. 

Let's get connected and bring our ideas to life!

```java
System.out.println("Happy coding!");
```
